# COVID-19Deployment

* Deplying COVID-19 predictive model using transfer learning via streamlit. 
* The deployment is for the model proposed [here](https://github.com/IDU-CVLab/COV19D_2nd).
* The deployment is attempted through a local host.

## Please Note: </br>
* You would need the saved model ('.h5') file to be able to replicate the code.
* If you wish to help, please send me an email to request the saved model.
