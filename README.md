# COVID-19Deployment
* An attempt to deply COVID-19 predictive model using transfer learning via streamlit. The deployment is attempted through a local host, but the saved model's size is large for deployment.
* The model is proposed [here](https://github.com/IDU-CVLab/COV19D_2nd).

## Please Note: </br>
* You would need the saved model ('.h5') file to be able to replicate the code.
* If you wish to help, please get in touch.
