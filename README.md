# COVID-19Deployment

Deplying COVID-19 prediction model using transfer learning via streamlit. The deployment is for the model proposed [here](https://github.com/IDU-CVLab/COV19D_2nd)

## Please Note: </br>
You would need the saved model ('.h5') file to be able to replicate the code.

If you wish to help, please send me an email for the saved model.
